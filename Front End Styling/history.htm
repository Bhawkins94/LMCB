				<h3>Who we are</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
				The Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau (LMCB) was originally established in 1930 as the Christmas Exchange. Today it serves as a centralized, year round toy warehouse for toys and gifts to be gathered, sorted, stored and shipped to Christmas Bureaus and Community agencies, across the entire metro Vancouver area. We ship up to 100,000 items every year.
				<br><br>
				We also serve as the local Christmas Bureau for Vancouver. The LMCB distributes toys, clothes and food vouchers to over a 1000 low income families in Vancouver during the holiday season.
				<br><br>
				<h3>Our Vision</h3>
				<br>
				Christmas is about family and friends and the experience of sharing and giving. It should be a happy time for everyone, especially for children. For over eighty-five years our number one goal has been to ensure that every child in our community has a smile on their face on Christmas Day.
				<br><br>
				<h3>Our mission</h3>
				<br>
				Here at the Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau, our mission is to empower families in need to create Christmas experiences for their kids through the generosity of community.
				<br><br>
				As a registered non-profit organization, the Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau relies on volunteers and  a number of fundraising events throughout the year to support our goals.
