					[start with the why for volunteering, also are there year round opportunities for volunteering?]
					<br><br>
					Christmas Toy Store Volunteer<br>
					Seasonal December<br>
					We are looking for adult volunteers to assist in our Toy Store for our Vancouver Christmas Giving Program.
					<br><br>
					Volunteers are needed from December 4th to December 20th, Monday-Fridays.
					<br><br>
					Volunteers will assist parents with choosing gifts for their children in a one-on-one setting as they shop in our free Christmas Toy Store.
					<br><br>
					Gift Sorting in LMCB's Warehouse<br>
					Monday to Friday shifts<br>
					The Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau collects, sorts and ships  75,000 to 100,000 items  every year. This takes a huge effort by many volunteers. If you have even a few hours to spare we welcome your support.
					<br><br>
					Group Volunteers<br>
					Seasonal<br>
					Our community teams of volunteers have expressed that it is a great team building activity to work together in what feels like Santaâ€™s warehouse of toys.  We schedule volunteer groups during our peak donation season that also coincides with our Christmas Toy Store Program.
					<br><br>
					Group volunteers are set up in our warehouse where toy counting and sorting toys into categories are done. Then if time permits, boxing the toys and labeling them are the next steps.  We also run a Toy Store onsite where some volunteers choose to help out and can help parents pick toys and clothes for their children.
