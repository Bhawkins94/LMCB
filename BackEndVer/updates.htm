					<center><strong>LMCB Renews Strategy</strong></center>
					<br>
					<p class="sansserif">
					The Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau is excited to announce that we have a done an extensive review and refreshed our strategy to ensure best practices are in place to further our mission to empower families in need to create Christmas experiences for their kids through the generosity of community. Our organization values respect for the families that we serve, inclusivity for families facing multiple barriers and collaboration with Christmas bureaus and agencies across the Lower Mainland.
					<br><br>
					Over the past year our volunteer Board of Directors have been working diligently to renew the future plans for the LMCB. We are proud to have a newly defined vision in the work ahead for the next five years.
					<br><br>
					The recurring feedback that we hear from families and supporters is that positive holiday experiences can change lives. Our focus remains dedicated to providing assistance to low-income families with kids from zero to eighteen years of age, because we believe that every family should feel the excitement of giving and receiving holiday gifts.
					<br><br>
					With this in mind, we are emboldened to develop our role as a regional networker and distributor in bringing together resources to support Christmas bureaus and agencies across the lower mainland and possibly further, to ship tens of thousands of toys and gifts for kids every year.
					<br><br>
					We are also committed to assisting Vancouver families in need, within our local community, through our annual Toy Store Program. Families in need are welcome to register with us during December to receive a grocery store gift card to purchase items for a warm Christmas meal, and Caregivers get to personally shop through our Toy Store to select gifts for each of their kids. We strive to facilitate a process that allows families to experience Christmas with dignity and an opportunity to personalize it with care for their kids.
					<br><br>
					With energy and enthusiasm, the LMCB is looking forward to strengthening our relationships with our supporters and creating new connections. Our thoughtful and generous donors and volunteers allow our work to be possible. Together we can continue our meaningful impact through all these combined contributions. We promise to model best practices in how we form community partnerships and how we serve families, because we can all recognize that itâ€™s all about the kids.
					<br><br>
					Thank you for your continued support for eighty-eight years and counting.
