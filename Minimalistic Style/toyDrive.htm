                Looking for ways to spread the holiday cheer and make Christmas brighter for kids in need this season? The Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau has a way to channel your thoughtfulness and spirit of giving!
                <br><br>
                Organize a Toy Drive to support the Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau.  We work year-round collecting toy donations for kids, from newborns to the big kids up to eighteen years of age.
                <br><br>
                Community, corporate and Office Toy Drive initiatives make it possible for us to meet our mission and yearly goals.  Join in the steps of like-minded supporters in collecting toys that will go to kids in need and put smiles on their faces for Christmas.
                <br><br>
                The Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau accepts new toys that are not gift-wrapped, gift items and cash donations. There is a larger need for gifts for tweens and teens. We try to limit the number of stuffed toys received as our warehouse is already overflowing with their cuteness.
                <br><br>
                Contact us to start your Toy Drive. We can send you LMCB posters to print to use for collection boxes or areas, provide donation forms to support the Toy Drive, and share news about your initiative on our social media channels.  If you would like to connect with someone directly or want more information, we are happy to be in touch.
                <br><br>
                What to do after the Toy Drive is complete
                <br>
When the Toy Drive is completed, items can be delivered to our warehouse. Please contact info@lmcb.ca to set-up a time for dropping donations off.
                <br><br>
                If you are unable to deliver the collected toys and gifts, a pick-up can be scheduled, by filling out our online form.
